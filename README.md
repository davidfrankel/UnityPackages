# UnityPackages

Custom packages for Unity's Package Manager.

Import to Package Manager using `https://github.com/davidfrankel/UnityPackages.git?path=/Packages/com.def.core`.

(Replace `com.def.core` with the package folder name.)

**NOTE:** As of 2022.01, Unity Package Manager custom dependencies (one custom package depending on another custom package) don't work for packages distributed over git. Until this changes, or until I distribute them a different way, you need to manually install all of a package's dependencies before you install the package itself.
