# Menus

A menu navigation library that supports both controller and mouse and keyboard.

### Features

* Switching between menu lists
* Add items to or removing items from menu lists
* Scrolling
* UI widgets embedded within menus.

### Roadmap

* Don't require the PlayerInput component.
* Confirm that DEF.Menus plays nice with DEF.Dialog.
* Add an intuitive, custom editor for MenuManager.
